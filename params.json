Works on iOS 5, iOS 6 and iOS 7.\r\n\r\nAs a reminder you will receive a daily notification so you don't forget to add a picture ;-)\r\n\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\nTo add a picture, click the plus icon. This will bring up a dialogue that lets you add a picture from your Camera Roll. Hit Edit to enter a title, or change the date on which the picture was taken.\r\n\r\nTap a picture in the list on the front page to show the picture and edit its properties or replace it. On iOS 6 and higher you can also share the picture to your favourite social networks. On iOS 5 you can save the picture back to the Camera Roll.\r\n\r\nSwipe an image in the list to delete it.\r\n\r\nTap the Info button to see how many pictures you've already taken, how many more you need to take until the end of the year and how much space your pictures are taking on on the device.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n-----\r\n\r\nI've written this app as a birthday present for my wife Julia. She wanted to track the daily weather changes and needed a simple mechanism to put those screenshots in one place. \r\n\r\nThis App is currently not available on the App Store.\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nDaily Pictures is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n(at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nThis programme is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
