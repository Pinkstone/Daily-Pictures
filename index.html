<p>This little iOS app lets you save a picture every day and add a note to it. Works on iOS 5, iOS 6 and iOS 7.</p>

<p>As a reminder you will receive a daily notification so you don't forget to add a picture ;-)</p>

<h2>
<a name="usage" class="anchor" href="#usage"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Usage</h2>

<p>To add a picture, click the plus icon. This will bring up a dialogue that lets you add a picture from your Camera Roll. Hit Edit to enter a title, or change the date on which the picture was taken.</p>

<p>Tap a picture in the list on the front page to show the picture and edit its properties or replace it. On iOS 6 and higher you can also share the picture to your favourite social networks. On iOS 5 you can save the picture back to the Camera Roll.</p>

<p>Swipe an image in the list to delete it.</p>

<p>Tap the Info button to see how many pictures you've already taken, how many more you need to take until the end of the year and how much space your pictures are taking on on the device.</p>

<h2>
<a name="notes" class="anchor" href="#notes"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Notes</h2>

<p>I've written this app as a birthday present for my wife Julia. She wanted to track the daily weather changes and needed a simple mechanism to put those screenshots in one place. </p>

<p>This App is currently not available on the App Store.</p>
